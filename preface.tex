\chapter*{Preface}

This is a rough in-progress dump of the book.  The grammar will probably be bad, there
will be sections missing, but you get to watch me write the book and see how I do things.

There is a mailing list for the book at
\href{mailto:lcthw@librelist.com}{lcthw@librelist.com} which you can join.
I'll be doing announcements as new material is up, and you can ask questions if
you get stuck or have comments. 

\emph{This list is a discussion list, not an an announce-only list.  It's for discussing the book and asking questions.}

Finally, don't forget that I have \href{http://learnpythonthehardway.org}{Learn
Python The Hard Way, 2nd Edition} which you should read if you can't code yet.
LCTHW will \emph{not} be for beginners, but for people who have at least read
LPTHW or know one other programming language.
